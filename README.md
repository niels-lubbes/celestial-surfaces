# Celestial surfaces


## Introduction

We present Mathematica code for the automatic verification
of some of the proofs in the article [Self-intersections of surfaces that contain two circles through each point](https://arxiv.org/abs/?).
The section titles below refer the environments in this article.

For running the code copy paste the code presented below in [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/).
The same code can be found in the Mathematica file [dP-surface-lattice.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niels-lubbes/cyclides/master/dP-surface-lattice.nb).
